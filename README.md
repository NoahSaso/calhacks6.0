# stegasaurus
Second Place Project at CalHacks 6.0, UC Berkeley's annual hackathon (2019).

Stegasaurus is a steganography tool that encodes/decodes images with encrypted text in a way that is undetectabe when only given the encoded image and that can still be decoded after going through industry-standard image compression. Currently, text is being encrypted with PGP which is already used to communicate securely. This tool in conjunction with PGP makes it easy to send encrypted messages through insecure channels without anyone knowing that a message is even being sent.
